I'm currently in my final year of my PhD program at the Information Engineering Department of the University of Padua, working with Prof. Andrea Zanella. My research is primarily focused on the intersection of systems, networking, and machine learning.

I have been awarded the prestigious Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Ph.D. Fellowship in 2021.
