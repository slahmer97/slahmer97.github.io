**Description:**

The SDN-based Intrusion Detection System utilizes the POX controller to monitor network traffic and identify potentially malicious activities. The system operates by analyzing network packets and applying predefined rules to detect patterns indicative of an intrusion.

**Key Features:**

- **POX Controller Integration:** The system is built on top of the POX controller, a widely-used SDN controller that provides a flexible framework for network management and control.
- **Rule-based Detection:** Intrusion detection rules are defined based on known attack signatures and anomalous network behavior. These rules are applied to incoming network traffic to identify suspicious patterns.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors network traffic in real-time, allowing for immediate detection and response to potential security threats.
- **Customizable Policies:** Administrators can define and customize intrusion detection policies to suit the specific security requirements of their network environment.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Code Repository:** The project code is available on GitHub for reference and further development.
- **Programming Language:** The system is implemented using Python programming language, leveraging POX controller APIs for SDN management.
